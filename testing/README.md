Writing Beautiful JavaScript Tests
==================================

What is a test?

---

Writing tests != TDD

---

Going to the tests vs going through the tests

---

Why do we write tests?

---

Should we write tests? What are we optimizing for in our tests?

---

Coding alone vs coding in a team

---

In a team, the first time you meet a test is usually when it fails

Why did it fail?

---

Treat your tests as you treat your application code

---

Refactor and clean up your tests regularly

---

Is having a 3:1 tests to code a good thing?

5 000 lines of app code, 20 000 lines of code to maintain

---

Static vs dynamic languages

Better tooling simplify working with many tests

---

Different types of tests -- unit, integration, ...

---

Do we agree on how to write tests?

Example: dhh, martin, beck (https://plus.google.com/events/ci2g23mk0lh9too9bgbp3rbut0k)

---

"... and I can't write a test for it because I don't even know what the inputs look like" -beck

---

What is a beautiful test?

---

Let's look at some techniques that have worked for me

---

`beforeEach`

---

Too long tests

---

Arrange, act, assert

---

Too much magic

---

Mocking what you don't own -- what happens when you update jQuery?
