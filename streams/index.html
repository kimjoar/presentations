# Playing with<br><em>streams</em></br> in Node.js

---

class: center, middle, dark, stream

So – what is a stream?

---

class: center, middle, huge

```
ls | sort -r | head -n1
```

---

class: center, middle, unix

> This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together. Write programs to <strong>handle text streams, because
that is a universal interface.</strong>

.right[— Doug McIlroy]

class: middle, larger

Streams are built into Node.js core

---

class: middle, huge

First, let's read from stdin:

```javascript
process.stdin
```

---

class: middle, larger

Data comes out of a<br>Readable stream

---

class: middle, larger

Starts flowing when you<br>listen for 'data' events

---

class: middle, dark, larger

let's do something with<br>the chunks

---

class: middle, large

```
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
```

No `Content-Length` — it's not known

---

class: middle, large

Pretty sweet when you have huge files

---

class: middle, larger

Data goes into a<br>Writable stream

---

class: middle, pipe

```javascript
readable.on('data', function(chunk) {
    writable.write(chunk);
});

readable.on('end', function() {
    writable.end();
});
```

---

class: middle, huge

```javascript
readable.pipe(writable);
```

---

class: middle, huge

Next step: piping several things

```
ls | sort -r | head -n1
```

---

class: middle, huge

```
readable
    .pipe(transform)
    .pipe(transform)
    .pipe(writable)
```

---

class: middle, dark, huge

A transform reads and writes data

---

class: middle, large

```
TypeError:
Invalid non-string/buffer chunk
```

---

class: middle, large

Streams work on strings and buffers

&nbsp;

---

class: middle, large

Streams work on strings and buffers

… but we can also make it work on objects

---

class: middle, center, large

```
{ objectMode: true }
```

tell a stream that it should be dealing<br>with objects instead of strings or buffers

---

class: middle, large

potentially one-to-many

we're not dealing with X kb of data, but with objects

---

class: middle

This doesn't look very good:

```javascript
var stream = require('stream');
var uppercase = new stream.Transform();

uppercase._transform = function(chunk, encoding, done) {
     var data = chunk.toString();
     this.push({ data: data.toUpperCase() });
     done();
}
```

---

class: middle, larger

Simplify stream creation with helper libs

---

class: middle, larger, dark

`through2`

---

class: middle, large

However …

Our data can be:

```
some data\ntesting\nyo
```

what if chunk 1 is:

```
some data\ntest
```

and chunk 2 is:

```
ing\nyo
```

---

class: middle

The solution is to keep track of last portion of each chunk

```javascript
var through = require('through2');
var logger = require('./logger');

process.stdin
    .pipe(through.obj(
        function (chunk, encoding, done) {
            var data = chunk.toString();
            if (this._lastLineData) data = this._lastLineData + data;

            var lines = data.split('\n');
            this._lastLineData = lines.pop();

            lines.forEach(function(line) {
                this.push({ line: line });
            }, this);
            done();
        },
        function() {
            if (this._lastLineData) this.push({ line: this._lastLineData });
            this._lastLineData = null
        }
    ))
    .pipe(logger());
```

class: middle, dark

it's already been solved (of course)

---

class: middle, huge

`event-stream`

---

class: middle

there is a lot of stream helpers

substack &amp; domenictarr

---

class: middle, huge

so far:

- readable — data comes out
- writable — data goes in
- transform — data is transformed

---

class: middle, dark, larger

the last type: duplex

data goes in, data comes out

---

class: middle, huge

```
a.pipe(b).pipe(a);
```

---

class: middle, larger

duplex is hard to<br>wrap your head around

---

other things:

flowing vs non-flowing

back pressure

Gulp

---

class: middle, center, large

A new build system for JavaScript based on streams

---

class: middle, center, large

Work on a stream of files

---

class: middle, center, larger, dark

Let's try

---

class: middle, center

That's it!

---

class: middle, large

A gulp plugin is just a transform stream

```javascript
readable
    .pipe(transform)
    .pipe(transform)
    .pipe(transform)
    .pipe(writable)
```

---

Sometimes we need to use other stream helpers

---

Concat files + add compiled templates

---

DRYing up

---

The stream consists of vinyl objects

… which is just a simple virtual file format

---

Let's create our own plugin

---

And you're now an expert Gulp user

# Streams recap

Just think about unix pipes

In Node.js it's just events

Lots of simple helpers

Create small, reusable pieces that can be composed together

Simple and powerful
